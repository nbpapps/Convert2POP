Implementing POP in an exciting app

One of the hardest parts for me when thinking about protocols, is when and where to use them. I understand the principle behind them, and Iâ€™ve read posts and seen videos on how to use them but could not figuring out of the use.

So I decided to make a basic project, that is used so often in IOS development - getting data from the network.

There are 3 branches in this repo:

Starting_Point - the project before any protocol

First_Phase - Protocols implemented in 3 classes

Second_Phase - optimizing some of the protocols

For more information about this project, see the this post and video
